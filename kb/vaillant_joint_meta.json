Plastic pipes\nmay be of different bore and resistance. Sizes and maximum\nlengths of plastic should be calculated using data prepared for\nthe type of pipe being used.\n5.1.6.1 Discharge pipe D1\n3.50 Each of the temperature relief valves or combined tem-\nperature and pressure relief valves specified in 3.13 or 3.17\nshould discharge either directly or by way of a manifold via a\nshort length of metal pipe (D1) to a tundish.\n3.51 The diameter of discharge pipe (D1) should be not less\nthan the nominal outlet size of the temperature relief valve.\n3.52 Where a manifold is used it should be sized to accept\nand discharge the total discharge from the discharge pipes\nconnected to it.\n3.53 Where valves other than the temperature and pres-\nsure relief valve from a single unvented hot water system\ndischarge by way of the same manifold that is used by the\nsafety devices, the manifold should be factory fitted as part\nof the hot water storage system unit or package.\n5.1.6.2 Tundish\n3.54 The tundish should be vertical, located in the same\nspace as the unvented hot water storage system and be fit-\nted as close as possible to, and lower than, the valve, with\nno more than 600 mm of pipe between the valve outlet and\nthe tundish. Note: To comply with the Water Supply (Water\nFittings) Regulations, the tundish should incorporate a suit-\nable air gap.\n3.55 Any discharge should be visible at the tundish. In addi-\ntion, where discharges from safety devices may not be ap-\nparent, e.g. in dwellings occupied by people with impaired\nvision or mobility, consideration should be given to the in-\nstallation of a suitable safety device to warn when discharge\ntakes place, e.g. electronically operated.\n3.56 The discharge pipe (D2) from the tundish should: (a)\nhave a vertical section of pipe at least 300 mm long below\nthe tundish before any elbows or bends in the pipework (see\ndiagram); and (b) be installed with a continuous fall there-\nafter of at least 1 in 200.5.1.6.3 Discharge pipe D2\n3.57 The discharge pipe (D2) should be made of: (a) metal;\nor (b) other material that has been demonstrated to be cap-\nable of safely withstanding temperatures of the water dis-\ncharged and is clearly and permanently marked to identify\nthe product and performance standard (e.g. as specified in\nthe relevant part of BS 7291).\n3.58 The discharge pipe (D2) should be at least one pipe\nsize larger than the nominal outlet size of the safety device\nunless its total equivalent hydraulic resistance exceeds that\nof a straight pipe 9 m long, i.e. for discharge pipes between\n9 m and 18 m the equivalent resistance length should be\nat least two sizes larger than the nominal outlet size of the\nsafety device; between 18 and 27 m at least 3 sizes lar-\nger, and so on; bends must be taken into account in cal-\nculating the flow resistance. See diagram, Table and the\nworked example. Note: An alternative approach for sizing\ndischarge pipes would be to follow Annex D, section D.2 of\nBS 6700:2006 Specification for design, installation, testing\nand maintenance of services supplying water for domestic\nuse within buildings and their curtilages.\n3.59 Where a single common discharge pipe serves more\nthan one system, it should be at least one pipe size larger\nthan the largest individual discharge pipe (D2) to be connec-\nted.\n3.60 The discharge pipe should not be connected to a soil\ndischarge stack unless it can be demonstrated that the soil\ndischarge stack is capable of safely withstanding temperat-\nures of the water discharged, in which case, it should:\n(a) contain a mechanical seal, not incorporating a water trap,\nwhich allows water into the branch pipe without allowing foul\nair from the drain to be ventilated through the tundish;\n(b) be a separate branch pipe with no sanitary appliances\nconnected to it;\n(c) if plastic pipes are used as branch pipes carrying dis-\ncharge from a safety device they should be either poly-\nbutylene (PB) to Class S of BS 7291-2:2006 or cross linked\npolyethylene (PE-X) to Class S of BS 7291-3:2006; and\n(d) be continuously marked with a warning that no sanitary\nappliances should be connected to the pipe.\nNote: 1",
